Intended to be ran by the regular user as `./main`, from the project base directory.

Notes:
Barrier is no longer maintained. Synergy is a paid alternative, but the active maintainers of Barrier have moved to a new project, input-leap, found at github.com/input-leap/input-leap. This is currently in development without any active releases, but once that has an official release it should be substituted for the Barrier package.
